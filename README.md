## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Array Operations
- Creating multi-dimensional arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)

- Concatenation, splitting, and sorting
- Indexing and slicing
- Views vs. Copies (memory management)

### 2. Random Number Generation
- **Binomial distribution**: Modeling number of successes in trials
- **Normal (Gaussian) distribution**: Bell curve, most common in statistics
- **Poisson distribution**: Modeling rare event occurrences
- **Uniform distribution**: Equal probability across range
- **Logistic distribution**: S-shaped cumulative distribution
- **Exponential distribution**: Modeling time between events
- **Chi-square distribution**: Hypothesis testing
- **Rayleigh distribution**: Magnitude of 2D normal vectors
- **Pareto distribution**: Power-law or "80/20" distributions
- **Zipf distribution**: Rank-based distributions
- **Multinomial distribution**: Extension of binomial to multiple categories

### 3. Universal Functions (ufuncs)
- Creating custom ufuncs
- Arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power

### 4. Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
- Base-2 logarithms (log2)
- Custom base logarithms
- Exponential operations

### 5. Aggregation and Reduction

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Arrays and Shapes
Arrays are the foundation of NumPy. They can have multiple dimensions:
- **1D array**: Like a list or vector
- **2D array**: Like a matrix or spreadsheet
- **3D array**: Like stacked matrices (blocks)

### Views vs Copies
```python
j = s.view()    # Shares memory - changes affect original
m = s.copy()    # Independent - changes don't affect original
```

### Universal Functions (ufuncs)
NumPy functions that operate element-wise on arrays for speed and efficiency.

### Broadcasting
NumPy automatically extends operations across arrays of different shapes when possible.

## 💡 Examples

### Creating and Manipulating Arrays
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3D array
arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
                [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])

# Reshape to new dimensions
reshaped = arr.reshape(2, 3, 2)

# Flatten to 1D
flattened = arr.reshape(-1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Find even numbers
indices = np.where(arr % 2 == 0)
```

### Working with Random Numbers
```python
# Generate 100 random values from normal distribution
data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=100)

# Poisson distribution (modeling rare events)
events = np.random.poisson(lam=10, size=100)

# Create visualizations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(data, bins=20)
plt.show()
```

### Mathematical Operations
```python
a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Element-wise operations
np.add(a1, a2)          # [7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
np.multiply(a1, a2)     # [6, 14, 24, 36, 50]

# Aggregation
np.sum(a1)              # 15
np.prod(a1)             # 120
np.cumsum(a1)           # [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
```

### Set Operations
```python
a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4]
a2 = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4]

np.unique(a1)                    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
np.union1d(a1, a2)               # Combine all unique elements
np.intersect1d(a1, a2)           # Common elements
np.setdiff1d(a1, a2)             # Elements in a1 but not a2
```
