## 🎯 Overview

This project provides a complete, hands-on introduction to NumPy—Python's fundamental package for numerical computing. Whether you're new to data science or looking to deepen your NumPy skills, this tutorial covers essential concepts with practical examples.

NumPy is used for:
- Working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
- Performing mathematical and statistical operations
- Data manipulation and analysis
- Building foundations for machine learning and scientific computing

- Reshaping and flattening arrays
- Concatenation, splitting, and sorting
- Indexing and slicing
- Views vs. Copies (memory management)

### 2. Random Number Generation
- **Binomial distribution**: Modeling number of successes in trials
- **Normal (Gaussian) distribution**: Bell curve, most common in statistics
- **Poisson distribution**: Modeling rare event occurrences
- **Uniform distribution**: Equal probability across range
- **Logistic distribution**: S-shaped cumulative distribution
- **Exponential distribution**: Modeling time between events
- **Chi-square distribution**: Hypothesis testing
- **Rayleigh distribution**: Magnitude of 2D normal vectors
- **Pareto distribution**: Power-law or "80/20" distributions
- **Zipf distribution**: Rank-based distributions
- **Multinomial distribution**: Extension of binomial to multiple categories

### 3. Universal Functions (ufuncs)

### 4. Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
- Base-2 logarithms (log2)
- Custom base logarithms
- Exponential operations

### 5. Aggregation and Reduction
- Summation and cumulative sums
- Products and cumulative products

### 6. Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions
- Sine, cosine, tangent functions
- Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh)
- Inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin, arccos)

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Arrays and Shapes
Arrays are the foundation of NumPy. They can have multiple dimensions:
- **1D array**: Like a list or vector
- **2D array**: Like a matrix or spreadsheet
- **3D array**: Like stacked matrices (blocks)

### Views vs Copies
```python
j = s.view()    # Shares memory - changes affect original
m = s.copy()    # Independent - changes don't affect original
```

### Universal Functions (ufuncs)
NumPy functions that operate element-wise on arrays for speed and efficiency.

### Broadcasting
NumPy automatically extends operations across arrays of different shapes when possible.

## 💡 Examples

### Creating and Manipulating Arrays
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3D array
arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]],
                [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])

# Reshape to new dimensions
reshaped = arr.reshape(2, 3, 2)

# Flatten to 1D
flattened = arr.reshape(-1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Find even numbers
indices = np.where(arr % 2 == 0)
```

### Working with Random Numbers
```python
# Generate 100 random values from normal distribution
data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=100)

# Poisson distribution (modeling rare events)
events = np.random.poisson(lam=10, size=100)

# Create visualizations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(data, bins=20)
plt.show()
```

### Mathematical Operations
```python
a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Element-wise operations
np.add(a1, a2)          # [7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
np.multiply(a1, a2)     # [6, 14, 24, 36, 50]

# Aggregation
np.sum(a1)              # 15
np.prod(a1)             # 120
np.cumsum(a1)           # [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
```

### Set Operations
```python
a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4]
a2 = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4]

np.unique(a1)                    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
np.union1d(a1, a2)               # Combine all unique elements
np.intersect1d(a1, a2)           # Common elements
np.setdiff1d(a1, a2)             # Elements in a1 but not a2
```
